# Air Quality Index

This plug-in gets the air quality information from http://aqicn.org.
Through your IP address the next nearby sensor station will be discovered.


## Supported Things

If you encounter that a value stays to zero, it means the sensor station
doesn't support that value.

Besides the air pollution level the plug-in also states a cautionary statement.
Both states can be used to let nymea notify you about the pollution level and
inform you what precautions should be taken.
