# Tuya

This plugin allows to make use of Tuya based devices through the Tuya cloud. This includes all the devices that work with the Smart Life app.

The plugin will allow logging in with the Smart Life app account and fetch all the devices connected to the Tuya/Smart Life cloud.

Currently supported devices:

* Smart plugs
* Lights [1]
* Roller shutters


[1] Please note, that light support is somewhat rudimentary as the Tuya cloud api does not allow integrating that very well.
