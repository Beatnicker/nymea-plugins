# Unitec

This plugin allows to controll RF 433 MHz actors an receive remote signals from [Unitec](http://www.unitec-elektro.de)
devices.

The unitec socket units have a learn function. If you plug in the switch, a red light will start to blink. This means
the socket is in the learning mode. Now you can add a Unitec switch (48111) to nymea with your desired Channel (A,B,C or D).
In order to pair the socket you just have to press the power ON, and the switch has to be in the pairing mode.
If the pairing was successful, the switch will turn on. If the switches will be removed from the socket or there will
be a power breakdown, the switch has to be re-paired. The device can not remember the teached channel.
